# Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Prediction
This is a basic Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Training of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It answers various questions including:
a) What is the distribution of diabetes status in the dataset? How many individuals are diagnosed with diabetes and how many are not?


b) Is there any relationship between glucose levels and the presence of diabetes? Can you compare the mean glucose levels for individuals with and without diabetes and determine if there is a significant difference using a hypothesis test?



c)  Analyze the distribution of skin thickness and blood pressure among individuals with and without diabetes. Are there any significant differences or patterns in skin thickness values and in the blood pressure values between the two groups?


d) Can you visualize the distribution of body mass index (BMI) for individuals with and without diabetes using a suitable plot, such as a boxplot or histogram? Are there any noticeable differences in BMI between the two groups?


e) What is the average age of individuals with diabetes compared to those without diabetes? Can you calculate and compare the mean ages for the two groups and analyze if there is a significant difference?

The second part of this is model training of the same dataset using Logistic Regression. The accuracy for this is 74%.
